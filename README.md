# MiniProjects
This folder contains a variety of data science related projects. A brief description of each is provided below:
1. AMES_HousingData_RegressionAnalysis_Model_Selection.pdf: A regression analysis with a specific focus automatic variable selection
and model refinement; conducted using the R language. The document follows a narrative and R outputs are provided in the appendices.
2. NYC_Yellow_Taxi_EDA_Model_Selection.ipynb: An EDA and model selection project for predicting taxi fares. Emphasis is on comparison 
of regression model fit.
3. Optimization_Academic.xlsx: An optimization exercise using the Excel Solver package.
4. Recursive_Algorithm.ipynb: Experiment with recursive programming.
5. SelectionSort()_Experiment.ipynb: Experiment with a selectionSort() algorithm.
6. Deep_Learning_Titanic_Data.ipynb: Comparison of ANNs on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
7. US_Gun_Deaths_2012_2014_Visual_Overview_PowerBI.pdf: PDF of a dashboard created using PowerBI.
8. Visualizing the Global Nuclear Power and Earthquake Risks.ipynb/pdf: Geospatial visualization project using the folium package. For 
interactivity one must download the ipynb file and open in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. The pdf is provided as a snapshot.
9. Regression_Models_AMES_Housing_Data.ipynb: Comparison of MLR model vs 2x2 experiment of Random Forest regressor models.
10. AutoML on Google Cloud Platform Application: Utilizes AutoML and Flask to deploy a predictive application for a churn tool (app is currently not deployed). Link: https://github.com/MWMartley001/Application1
